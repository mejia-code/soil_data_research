# SoilSpec4GG
SoilSpec4GG is pleased to release the first beta version of the OSSL explorer and calibration engine. These applications are a work in progress and we have provided these services with the hope of receiving feedback that will enable us to improve the functioning and utility of services.

SoilSpec4GG is a USDA-funded Food and Agriculture Cyberinformatics Tools Coordinated Innovation Network (USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture Award #2020-67021-32467 ). This project brings together soil scientists, spectroscopists, informaticians, data scientists and software engineers to overcome some of the current bottlenecks preventing wider and more efficient use of soil spectroscopy. It includes a series of working groups to address topics including calibration transfer, model choice, outreach & demonstration, and use of spectroscopy to inform global carbon cycle modeling.
For a brief introduction to the project, please visit the https://soilspectroscopy.org/.
