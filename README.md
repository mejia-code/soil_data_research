The purpose of these series of articls is to explore a path from data collection and analisys to data visualization and machine learning.

My background is in operations, analisys and mathemtics.

Special interest to me is the environment and the field of soil science concering the **health** of the soil system.

Coincidentaly, Hacker News lead me to this acrticle about this open soil sofware development.

## The Open Soil Spectral Library (OSSL)

The Open Soil Spectral Library (OSSL) is a global good project which serves collection of soil properties derived from spectral data. OSSL is also a network that delivers robust statistical models specifically calibration and predictions models, research tools, and oportiunities to collaborate across borders.

The initiative is funded through the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (USDA).
[NIFA](https://www.nifa.usda.gov/about-nifa/press-releases/nifa-invests-over-7-million-big-data-artificial-intelligence-other) has invested over $7 Million in Big Data, Artificial Intelligence, and Other Cyberinformatics Research.

The OSSL project offers a beautifully developed software:

and a user manual open for contribution:

# Soil Data Research

Spectroscopic studies are designed so that the radiant energy interacts with specific types of matter.

Soil spectroscopy is the measurement of light absorption when light in the visible, near infrared or mid infrared (Vis–NIR–MIR) regions of the electromagnetic spectrum is applied to a soil surface. The proportion of the incident radiation reflected by soil is sensed through Vis–NIR–MIR reflectance spectroscopy. These characteristic spectra (see Fig. below) can then be used to estimate numerous soil attributes including: minerals, organic compounds and water.

radiant energy is the energy of electromagnetic and gravitational radiation.[1] As energy, its SI unit is the joule (J). The quantity of radiant energy may be calculated by integrating radiant flux (or power) with respect to time.

The central theory of spectroscopy is that light is made of different wavelengths and that each wavelength corresponds to a different frequency. The importance of spectroscopy is centered around the fact that every different element in the periodic table has a unique light spectrum described by the frequencies of light it emits or absorbs consistently appearing in the same part of the electromagnetic spectrum when that light is diffracted.

spectroscopy, study of the absorption and emission of light and other radiation by matter, as related to the dependence of these processes on the wavelength of the radiation. More recently, the definition has been expanded to include the study of the interactions between particles such as electrons, protons, and ions, as well as their interaction with other particles as a function of their collision energy.

## Soil

It is a living system and life-sustaining resource. It teams up with billions of bacteria, fungi, and other microbes to create a [soil community](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/microbial-community) filled with diverse soil biota.

### Ingredientes That Create Soil:

- minerals
- gas
- water
- soil organic matter (SOM)
- living organisms
- Soild Organic Carbon (SOC)

[Soil organic matter](https://www.nature.com/scitable/knowledge/library/what-are-soils-67647639/#:~:text=Soil%20is%20a%20material%20composed,mineralogy%20of%20soils%20is%20diverse.) is plant, animal, and microbial residues in various states of decomposition. Higher SOC is among the best indicators of agricultural soil quality.

Soil minerals give soil the different texture attritubtes and colors. They are classified by size: clay, silt, and sand.

For example, the below picture shows different soil samples demonstrating the interaction of sand-clay textures versus SOM compositions

Soil color is produced by the minerals present and by the organic matter content. Yellow or red soil indicates the presence of oxidized ferric iron oxides. Dark brown or black color in soil indicates that the soil has a high organic matter content. Wet soil will appear darker than dry soil.

Th (Figure 1); the percentages of particles in these size classes is called soil texture. The mineralogy of soils is diverse.

For example, a clay mineral called smectite can shrink and swell so much upon wetting and drying

(Figure 2) that it can knock over buildings. The most common mineral in soils is quartz; it makes beautiful crystals but it is not very reactive.

Soil organic matter is plant, animal, and microbial residues in various states of decomposition; it is a critical ingredient — in fact the percentage of soil organic matter in a soil is among the best indicators of agricultural soil quality (http://soils.usda.gov/sqi/) (Figure 3).

Soil colors range from the common browns, yellows, reds, grays, whites, and blacks to rare soil colors such as greens and blues.

Soil is the naturally occurring part of the earth's surface that is composed of the minerals, organic and inorganic materials that are present in the earth's crust.

# Importance of Soil

[soil biota](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/soil-biota)

[soil carbon](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/soil-carbon)

[soil community](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/microbial-community)

As some might simply explain:
Dirt feeds plants, plants feed animals and some animals eat other animals.

However, the importance of undertaidng the omposition og the soil at eac soil site is key for the environmental protection of the earth.

Soil organic C binds mineral particles to form aggregates (Oades, 1993), whose distribution and stability influence the soil’s physical properties, including pore size distribution, bulk density, soil strength, and soil erodibility (Tatarko, 2001; Chapter 3: Microbial Modulators and Mechanisms of Soil Carbon Storage).

Loss of organic matter affects soil structure and aggregate formation, with negative impacts on biological diversity, soil fertility, crop production potential, erosion control, water retention, matter exchange between soil, atmosphere, groundwater, and the filtering, buffering, and transforming capacity of terrestrial ecosystems (Huber et al., 2001; Kirchmann and Andersson, 2001).

Soil management practices that improve formation of soil aggregates through an increase in SOC have demonstrated minimizing soil and nutrient losses through erosion mitigation and eutrophication of surface waters (Srinivasarao et al., 2015). The success of these soil management systems, however, relies strongly on site-specific characteristics, farmers’ awareness and knowledge, and often on weather events.

Aquatic microbial community can be defined as an assemblage of co-occurring, and potentially interacting, microbes, present in a defined habitat in space and time. Despite the small size, microorganisms are key elements for the ecological dynamics of the biosphere. They are not only the most diffused life forms; they are also characterized by an incredible functional and genetic diversity, contributing fundamentally to the biogeochemical processes on Earth.

## Spectroscopy

Visible and near infraread light [VIS-NIR](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/reflectance-spectroscopy#:~:text=NEAR%2DINFRARED%20REFLECTANCE%20SPECTROSCOPY%20ANALYSIS,%2C%20energy%2C%20and%20mineral%20content.)

![Explorer](images/soil_spectrum.png)

The reflected infrared radiation is converted to electrical energy and fed to a computer for interpretation. Each major organic component of the soil absorbs and reflects visible, near-infrared light, and mid-infrared light differently. By measuring these different reflectance characteristics, the Spectroradiometer and a computer determine the quantity of these components in the soil sample.
