Soil [aggregates](https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/nrcs142p2_052820.pdf)are groups of soil particles binding to each others more strongly than to other adjecent particles leaving voids for both water and air.

Soil structure is influenced by texture, clay mineralogy, climatic wet–dry and freeze–thaw cycles, characteristics of the plants and organic matter, and activities of soil biota. The [soil biota](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/soil-biota) provide key macroaggregates promotes soil structure by contributing organic matter in the form of plant litter , faunal fecal material (Frouz, 2018), and microbial residues (Abiven et al., 2009; Kallenbach et al., 2016).

Roots and fungi also physically bind soil particles together (i.e., enmeshment) and release substances such as the glycoprotein glomalin that act as binding agents, which promote soil aggregate stability.

Larger aggregates are called macroaggregaesa compried of visible SOM decomposable by light while smaller aggregates are called microaggregaes.

there are several

Biological processes that result in the formation of “biological macroaggregates”:\
(1) Fresh plant- and root-derived residues form the nucleation sites for the growth of fungi and bacteria. Macroaggregate formation is initiated by fungal hyphae enmeshing fine particles into macroaggregates. Exudates from both bacteria and fungi, produced as a consequence of decomposition of fresh residues, form binding agents that further stabilize macroaggregates.

(2) Biological macroaggregates also form around growing roots in soils, with roots and their exudates enmeshing soil particles, thereby stimulating microbial activity

(3) A third principal mechanism of biological macroaggregate formation in soils in all climates is via the action of soil fauna, particularly earthworms, termites, and ants. For example, earthworms often produce casts that are rich in organic matter and are not stable when freshly formed and wet. During gut passage, the soil and organic materials are kneaded thoroughly and copious amounts of watery mucus are added as well. This molding process breaks bonds between soil particles, but can lead to casts that are quite stable upon drying. It is also worth noting that soil mesofauna, for example collembola and mites, are important in the SOM formation process through their production of copious amounts of fecal pellets. Effects of meso- and macrofauna on soil structure are discussed further in Chapter 4 on soil fauna.

Organism abundance, diversity, and activity are not randomly distributed in soil, but vary in a patchy fashion both horizontally across a landscape and vertically through the soil profile. Different groups

Soil is living body of minerals, living organism, soil organic matter (SOM), gas and water.

Soil aggregates

also a stable [aggregated](https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/nrcs142p2_052820.pdf) structure: soil particles binding to each others more strongly than to other adjecent particles leaving voids for both water and air.

Soil structure refers to the proportions of solids and voids in a soil, the voids providing the space for both water and air. A key aspect of soil structure is the aggregation of individual mineral and organic particles into larger units (Binkley and Fisher, 2013). Soil structure is influenced by characteristics of the soil (especially texture and clay mineralogy), climatic factors (especially wet–dry and freeze–thaw cycles), characteristics of the plants and organic matter, and activities of soil biota (Daynes et al., 2013; Rashid et al., 2016; Bronick and Lal, 2005; Regelink et al., 2015). The soil biota promotes soil structure by contributing organic matter in the form of plant litter (especially root litter; Rasse et al., 2005), faunal fecal material (Frouz, 2018), and microbial residues (Abiven et al., 2009; Kallenbach et al., 2016). Roots and fungi also physically bind soil particles together (i.e., enmeshment) and release substances such as the glycoprotein glomalin that act as binding agents, which promote soil aggregate stability

soil is made up of different-sized mineral particles (sand, silt, and clay) including organic matter.

and has complex biological, chemical, physical, mineralogical, and hydrological properties that are always changing over time. Soil is ubiquitous and is dynamic, teeming with organisms, and is an integral part of both terrestrial and aquatic environments. But for farmers, gardeners, and agronomists, soil is just a medium for growing crops, pastures, and plants. And for engineers, soil is a material to build on and excavate. Thus soils can be both naturally occurring, comprising natural minerals and organic materials, and human-made, such as those that often contain very small amounts of manufactured materials, including brick fragments, explosive residues, or paint flecks. It is this soil diversity and heterogeneity that has enabled forensic soil examiners to distinguish between soils that may appear to be similar to the untrained observer.

### Common studied components of soil

- minerals
- gas
- H2O
- Carbon
- Nitrogen
- Clay Formation
- soil organic matter (SOM)
- living organisms
- soild organic Carbon (SOC)
- soil fauna
- macroaggregate and microaggregate:
- microaggregate

Soil color is produced by the minerals present and by the organic matter content. Yellow or red soil indicates the presence of oxidized ferric iron oxides. Dark brown or black color in soil indicates that the soil has a high organic matter content. Wet soil will appear darker than dry soil.

Th (Figure 1); the percentages of particles in these size classes is called soil texture. The mineralogy of soils is diverse.

For example, a clay mineral called smectite can shrink and swell so much upon wetting and drying

(Figure 2) that it can knock over buildings. The most common mineral in soils is quartz; it makes beautiful crystals but it is not very reactive.

# Importance of Soil

[soil biota](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/soil-biota)

[soil community](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/microbial-community)

As some might simply explain:
Dirt feeds plants, plants feed animals and some animals eat other animals.

## However, the importance of understanding the composition of the soil at each soil site is key for the environmental protection of the earth.

Soil organic C binds mineral particles to form aggregates (Oades, 1993), whose distribution and stability influence the soil’s physical properties, including pore size distribution, bulk density, soil strength, and soil erodibility (Tatarko, 2001; Chapter 3: Microbial Modulators and Mechanisms of Soil Carbon Storage).

Loss of organic matter affects soil structure and aggregate formation, with negative impacts on biological diversity, soil fertility, crop production potential, erosion control, water retention, matter exchange between soil, atmosphere, groundwater, and the filtering, buffering, and transforming capacity of terrestrial ecosystems (Huber et al., 2001; Kirchmann and Andersson, 2001).

Soil management practices that improve formation of soil aggregates through an increase in SOC have demonstrated minimizing soil and nutrient losses through erosion mitigation and eutrophication of surface waters (Srinivasarao et al., 2015). The success of these soil management systems, however, relies strongly on site-specific characteristics, farmers’ awareness and knowledge, and often on weather events.

Aquatic microbial community can be defined as an assemblage of co-occurring, and potentially interacting, microbes, present in a defined habitat in space and time. Despite the small size, microorganisms are key elements for the ecological dynamics of the biosphere. They are not only the most diffused life forms; they are also characterized by an incredible functional and genetic diversity, contributing fundamentally to the biogeochemical processes on Earth.

Carbon Sequestration (CSeq) is a process that converts organic matter into carbon.
